## Reporting Security Issues

We take  security seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue,
instead send your report privately to us via [email](mailto:hey@whispeer.me?subject=Security%20Issue).
This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that _are_ found
can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)
to any affected parties.

## Reporting Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Node.js you're using
* The version of PostgreSQL, if relevant
* Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
* The full output of any server logs, errors, or stack traces
* A code snippet or a link to a repository that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Information about the HTTP request that triggered the issue, including request method, headers, and body, if applicable
* Details about any related environment variables or configuration settings
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem, such as network configurations or specific interactions with other services

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Opening Pull Requests

We respect the contributors' labor more than anything, so, we would like to confirm your contributions are made by the true person through your public GPG Key that validates your full name and email address.

**Pull Requests will be merged only after they are signed with valid GPG signatures from the author.**
